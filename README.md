# Another Weather Api

For this exercise I have created a weather app using OpenWeatherAPI

Setup an express server with 2 endpoints, one for /nearby and one for /search/:city

Setup fetch requests to OpenWeatherApi from an express server, using node-fetch.

/nearby gets the weather near the user. (((This can be done using HTML Geolocation.)))

/search/:city takes users input and gets the current weather for a specific location.

## The layout of the app

City

Nicely displayed data

Interactive measurement change

Searchbox

## Criteria:

On pageload nearby weather should be displayed.
If you input a city, the weather for that city should be displayed
Display an icon showing whether or not it's raining, sunny or cloudy etc.

## Feel free to add more features. Here are some ideas!
Images from the current city
Wind speed and what direction the wind is coming from
Feels-like-temperatures
Being able to check the weather the upcoming days
Etc.
